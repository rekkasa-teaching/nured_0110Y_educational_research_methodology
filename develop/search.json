    "section": "Οι μέθοδοι της γνώσης",
    "text": "Οι μέθοδοι της γνώσης\nΟ φιλόσοφος Charles Peirce αναγνώρισε τέσσερις διαφορετικές μεθόδους μάθησης. Αυτές είναι:\n\nΗ μέθοδος της εμμονής: Οι άνθρωποι διατηρούν κάποιες πεποιθήσεις μόνο και μόνο επειδή πάντοτε τις είχαν. Αυτό έχει ως συνέπεια, πολύ συχνά να εμμένουν πεισματικά στις ιδέες τους, στηρίζοντας την παραγωγή νέας γνώσης σε λανθασμένες υποθέσεις.\nΗ μέθοδος της αυθεντίας: Τα άτομα στρέφονται για την αλήθεια σε όσους κατέχουν θέσεις κύρους: στην εκκλησία, στους ηγέτες τους, στους ανωτέρους τους και στους ειδικούς. Αν μια ιδέα έχει δημόσια/κοινωνική αποδοχή, τότε θεωρείται αληθής. Ο Peirce υποστηρίζει ότι η μέθοδος της αυθεντίας είναι ανώτερη από τη μέθοδο της εμμονής, διότι μέσω αυτής μπορεί να επιτευχθεί ανθρώπινη πρόοδος–έστω και αργά. Η αυθεντία φαίνεται να αποτελεί αναγκαία συνθήκη της κοινωνικής ζωής. Συχνά, οι ομάδες ανθρώπων αποδέχονται ως νομιμοποιημένη εξουσία σε όσους βρίσκονται σε θέσεις αυθεντίας. Δηλαδή, η ομάδα νομιμοποιεί την πεποίθηση ότι οι φορείς αυθεντίας έχουν όχι μόνο το δικαίωμα αλλά και την υποχρέωση να καθοδηγούν τους άλλους.\nΗ μέθοδος της διαίσθησης: βασίζεται σε παραδοχές που είναι προφανείς – τέτοιοι ισχυρισμοί γίνονται δεκτοί ως αυτονόητοι. Ενδέχεται να συμφωνούν με τη λογική, αλλά όχι κατ’ ανάγκην με την εμπειρία. Η ιδέα φαίνεται να είναι ότι τα άτομα μπορούν να ανακαλύψουν την αλήθεια χρησιμοποιώντας τον λόγο και τη λογική, επειδή υπάρχει μια φυσική ροπή προς την αλήθεια. Δεν ισχύει πάντα αυτό. Σήμερα γνωρίζουμε ότι ο κόσμος είναι σφαιρικός και όχι επίπεδος, παρότι επί αιώνες η επίπεδη γη ήταν αυτονόητη για τους ανθρώπους. Το κριτήριο της μεθόδου της διαίσθησης είναι ότι το υπό εξέταση ζήτημα είναι «αυτονόητο» και απλώς «στέκει λογικά». Δυστυχώς, πολλές αυτονόητες θέσεις απλώς δεν είναι αληθείς.\nΗ αναστοχαστική μέθοδος (επιστημονική μέθοδος): παρέχει έναν τρόπο να παγιώνονται οι πεποιθήσεις έτσι ώστε «το τελικό συμπέρασμα κάθε ανθρώπου να πρέπει να είναι το ίδιο». Η επιστημονική προσέγγιση διαθέτει δύο μοναδικά χαρακτηριστικά που απουσιάζουν από τις άλλες μεθόδους γνώσης: η επιστήμη είναι αυτοκριτική και αυτοδιορθωτική. Αυτές οι δικλείδες έχουν σχεδιαστεί ώστε να ελέγχουν και να επαληθεύουν τις διαδικασίες και τα πειράματα και να παράγουν αξιόπιστα αποτελέσματα. Ακόμη κι αν μια υπόθεση υποστηρίζεται, ο ερευνητής παραμένει σκεπτικός και αναζητά ανταγωνιστικές υποθέσεις, προσπαθώντας να εντοπίσει αντιπαραδείγματα και να βελτιώσει τα ευρήματα."

    "text": "Η επιστημονική μέθοδος\nΗ αντικειμενικότητα είναι βασικό στοιχείο της επιστημονικής μεθόδου. Είναι η κρίση για τα πράγματα η οποία στέκεται έξω και χωριστά από το άτομο (επιστήμονα) και δεν επηρεάζεται από προσωπικές προτιμήσεις και μεροληπτικές αντιλήψεις. Στα πλαίσια της εκπαιδευτικής έρευνας, η αντικειμενικότητα είναι χαρακτηριστικό της μεθόδου που υιοθετείται και όχι κατ’ανάγκη του ατόμου που την υιοθετεί. Στόχος είναι οι μέθοδοι που θα χρησιμοποιηθούν να είναι ξεκάθαρες και ακριβείς ώστε να διασφαλίζεται η δυνατότητα επανάληψης των αποτελεσμάτων από τρίτους.\nΈνας από τους βασικούς πυλώνες της επιστημονικής μεθόδου είναι η σκέψη και ο συλλογισμός. Ο συλλογισμός μπορεί να είναι επαγωγικός ή παραγωγικός.\n\n\nΕίδη συλλογισμού\n\nΟ επαγωγικός συλλογισμός που στηρίζεται στη γενίκευση συμπερασμάτων από την παρατήρηση περιορισμένου αριθμού σχετικών γεγονότων ή εμπειριών.\nΟ παραγωγικός συλλογισμός περιλαμβάνει την εξαγωγή συμπερασμάτων πατώντας πάνω σε γενικές αρχές, παρατηρήσεις και εμπειρίες (γενικεύσεις).\n\nΠαρά τα πολλά πλεονεκτήματά τους, τόσο ο επαγωγικός όσο και ο παραγωγικός συλλογισμός συχνά δεν επαρκούν για την κατανόηση του κόσμου πέρα από το άμεσο περιβάλλον του παρατηρητή. Πρέπει να συνδυαστούν με την επιστημονική μέθοδο, ώστε να αντληθούν στο μέγιστο τα πλεονεκτήματά τους. Η επιστημονική μέθοδος είναι μία τακτοποιημένη διαδικασία συγκεκριμένων βημάτων: αναγνώριση ενός προβλήματος, διατύπωση των επιστημονικών υποθέσεων, συλλογή δεδομένων, ανάλυση των δεδομέων, διατύπωση συμπερασμάτων με επιβεβαίωση ή απόρριψη των αρχικών υποθέσεων.\nΗ εφαρμογή της επιστημονικής μεθόδου υπονοεί την παραδοχή διάφορων υποθέσεων, ακόμα και αν πολύ συνχά αυτές δεν περιγράφονται συγκεκριμένα. Μερικές από αυτές είναι:\n\nΥπάρχει ένας κόσμος ο οποίος μπορεί να μελετηθεί, ακόμα και αν αυτός ο κόσμος είναι ο εσωτερικός κόσμος του ατόμου — όπως συμβαίνει συχνά στην εκπαιδευτική έρευνα.\nΈνα μέρος του κόσμου είναι μοναδικό, ένα μέρος είναι κανονικό ή εμφανίζει μοτίβα και είναι προβλέψιμο, ενώ ένα μεγάλο μέρος είναι δυναμικό (μεταβαλλόμενο) και σύνθετο (περιλαμβάνει πολλά αλληλεπιδρόντα στοιχεία). Σημαντικό καθήκον της επιστημονικής έρευνας είναι να εντοπίζει το προβλέψιμο μέρος του κόσμου, με στόχο την εξαγωγή συμπερασμάτων για περισσότερα από ένα άτομο.\nΤο μοναδικό, το κανονικό και το σύνθετο στον κόσμο μπορούν να μελετηθούν.\nΜπορούμε να διακρίνουμε μεταξύ περισσότερο και λιγότερο εύλογων ισχυρισμών, καθώς και μεταξύ έρευνας υψηλής και χαμηλής ποιότητας. Για παράδειγμα, μέσω εμπειρικής έρευνας μπορούμε να επιλέξουμε ανάμεσα σε ανταγωνιστικές θεωρίες διαπιστώνοντας ποια ταιριάζει καλύτερα στα δεδομένα. Μπορούμε επίσης να αξιολογήσουμε την ποιότητα μιας μελέτης εξετάζοντας τις ερευνητικές στρατηγικές που εφαρμόστηκαν και τα τεκμήρια που παρέχονται για καθένα από τα συμπεράσματα που εξάγει ο/η ερευνητής/τρια.\n\nοι δυνατότητες της επιστημονικής μεθόδου δεν είναι ατελείωτες, αλλά υπάρχουν σημαντικοί περιορισμοί που πρέπει να γνωρίζει οποιοσδήποτε θέλει να ασχοληθεί με την εκπαιδευτική έρευνα:\n\nΔεν μπορούν όλα τα ερωτήματα να απαντηθούν μόνο με τη χρήση της επιστημονικής μεθόδου. Για παράδειγμα, υπάρχουν ζητήματα όπως η νομιμοποίηση της ευθανασίας που αφορούν προσωπικές φιλοσοφίες, ηθική και αξίες που δεν μπορούν αξιολογηθούν στα πλαίσια μίας επιστημονικής μελέτης.\nΗ εφαρμογή των αρχών της επιστημονικής μεθόδου δεν μπορεί ποτέ να οδηγήσει στην πλήρη κατανόηση του συνόλου των φαινομένων που μελετώνται. Η εξαγωγή των συμπερασμάτων στηρίζεται στη μελέτη μίας απλοποιημένης εκδοχής της πραγματικότητας.\nΌλες οι μετρήσεις πάντα συνοδεύονται από κάποιο βαθμό σφάλματος ενώ τα μεγέθη που μετρώνται συνήθως αφορούν υποκατάστατα των πραγματικών.\n\n\n\nΕπιστημονική έρευνα\n\nΕπιστημονική έρευνα είναι η τυπική, συστηματική εφαρμογή της επιστημονικής μεθόδου στη μελέτη προβλημάτων\nΕκπαιδευτική έρευνα είναι η τυπική, συστηματική εφαρμογή της επιστημονικής μεθόδου στη μελέτη εκπαιδευτικών προβλημάτων.\n\nΣυνήθως, μία επιστημονική μελέτη εκτελείται ακολουθώντας μία προκαθορισμένη ακολουθία βημάτων που περιγράφονται παρακάτω:\n\nΕπιλογή και ορισμός προβλήματος: Ένα πρόβλημα είναι ένα ερώτημα ενδιαφέροντος που μπορεί να ελεγχθεί ή να απαντηθεί μέσω της συλλογής και ανάλυσης δεδομένων. Αφού εντοπιστεί το ερευνητικό ερώτημα, οι ερευνητές συνήθως ανασκοπούν τη βιβλιογραφία στο ίδιο θέμα και χρησιμοποιούν αυτές τις πληροφορίες για να διατυπώσουν εύλογες και τεκμηριωμένες υποθέσεις για τα αποτελέσματα.\nΣυλλογή δεδομένων: Σε μεγάλο βαθμό, οι διαδικασίες συλλογής δεδομένων καθορίζονται από το ερευνητικό ερώτημα και τις μεταβλητές της μελέτης.\nΑνάλυση δεδομένων: Τα δεδομένα αναλύονται με τρόπο που επιτρέπει στον/στην ερευνητή/τρια να ελέγξει την ερευνητική υπόθεση ή να απαντήσει στο ερευνητικό ερώτημα. Η ανάλυση συνήθως περιλαμβάνει την εφαρμογή μίας ή περισσότερων στατιστικών τεχνικών. Σε ορισμένες μελέτες, η ανάλυση περιλαμβάνει λεκτική σύνθεση αφηγηματικών δεδομένων. Τέτοιες μελέτες συνήθως προσφέρουν νέες ιδέες για τα υπό εξέταση φαινόμενα, παράγουν υποθέσεις για μελλοντική έρευνα ή και τα δύο.\nΕξαγωγή και διατύπωση συμπερασμάτων: Τα συμπεράσματα βασίζονται στα αποτελέσματα της ανάλυσης των δεδομένων. Πρέπει να διατυπώνονται σε σχέση με την αρχική υπόθεση ή το ερευνητικό ερώτημα. Τα συμπεράσματα θα πρέπει να υποδεικνύουν, για παράδειγμα, αν η ερευνητική υπόθεση υποστηρίχθηκε ή όχι. Στις μελέτες που βασίζονται σε λεκτική σύνθεση, τα συμπεράσματα είναι πολύ πιο επιφυλακτικά."

    "text": "Προσεγγίσεις στην εκπαιδευτική έρευνα\nΚάθε εκπαιδευτική διερεύνηση τελικά συνεπάγεται μια απόφαση να μελετηθεί ή να περιγραφεί κάτι — να τεθεί ένα ερώτημα και να αναζητηθεί μια απάντηση. Κάθε εκπαιδευτική διερεύνηση προϋποθέτει ότι θα συλλεχθεί κάποιο είδος δεδομένων, ότι τα δεδομένα θα αναλυθούν με κάποιον τρόπο και ότι ο/η ερευνητής/τρια θα καταλήξει σε κάποιο συμπέρασμα ή ερμηνεία. Με άλλα λόγια, κάθε εκπαιδευτική διερεύνηση μοιράζεται τις ίδιες τέσσερις βασικές ενέργειες που βρίσκουμε στην επιστημονική μέθοδο. Ωστόσο, δεν είναι ακριβές να λέμε ότι όλη η εκπαιδευτική έρευνα αποτελεί εφαρμογή της επιστημονικής μεθόδου. Υπάρχουν σημαντικές διαφορές ανάμεσα στους τύπους ερωτημάτων που θέτουν οι ερευνητές, στους τύπους δεδομένων που συλλέγουν, στη μορφή ανάλυσης των δεδομένων και στα συμπεράσματα που ο/η ερευνητής/τρια μπορεί να εξαγάγει με νόημα και εγκυρότητα.\nΜπορούμε να ξεχωρίσουμε δύο γενικές κατευθύνσεις στην εκτέλεση της επιστημονικής έρευνας: την διερευνητική και την επιβεβαιωτική. Στην επιβεβαιωτική προσέγγιση ο/η ερευνητής/τρια κάνει παρατηρήσεις, τις μελετά αναζητώντας μοτίβα και προτείνει συμπεράσματα και γενικεύσεις. Αντίθετα, στην επιβεβαιωτική προσέγγιση, ο/η ερευνητής/τρια ξεκινά από την διατύπωση μίας λογικής (με βάση τις υπάρχουσες θεωρίες) υπόθεσης, συλλέγει τα δεδομένα που θα χρησιμοποιηθούν για τον έλεγχο της υπόθεσης και αποφασίζει αν θα αποδεχτεί ή αν θα απορρίψει την υπόθεση με βάση τα δεδομένα που έχει μπροστά του/της.\nΌποια κατεύθυνση και αν επιλεγεί από τον/την ερευνητή/τρια, θα χρειαστει να καθοριστεί και μία συγκεκριμένη ερευνητική προσέγγιση. Οι ερευνητικές προσεγγίσεις είναι σχέδια και διαδικασίες για την έρευνα που καλύπτουν τα στάδια από τις ευρείες παραδοχές έως τις λεπτομερείς μεθόδους συλλογής, ανάλυσης και ερμηνείας δεδομένων. Το σχέδιο αυτό συνεπάγεται αρκετές αποφάσεις, οι οποίες δεν χρειάζεται να ληφθούν με τη σειρά που μας φαίνεται λογική ούτε με τη σειρά παρουσίασής τους εδώ. Η συνολική απόφαση αφορά ποια προσέγγιση θα χρησιμοποιηθεί για τη μελέτη ενός θέματος. Την απόφαση αυτή θα πρέπει να καθοδηγούν οι φιλοσοφικές παραδοχές που φέρνει ο/η ερευνητής/τρια στη μελέτη, οι διαδικασίες διερεύνησης (οι λεγόμενοι «σχεδιασμοί έρευνας») και οι συγκεκριμένες ερευνητικές μέθοδοι συλλογής, ανάλυσης και ερμηνείας δεδομένων. Η επιλογή μιας ερευνητικής προσέγγισης βασίζεται επίσης στη φύση του υπό εξέταση ερευνητικού προβλήματος ή ζητήματος, στις προσωπικές εμπειρίες των ερευνητών και στο κοινό στο οποίο απευθύνεται η μελέτη.\nΓενικά, οι επιστημονικές προσεγγίσεις μπορούν να χωριστούν σε τρεις μεγάλες κατηγορίες: τις ποσοστικές προσεγγίσεις, τις ποιοτικές προσεγγίσεις και τις μικτές προσεγγίσεις.\nΟι ποσοτικές ερευνητικές προσεγγίσεις αφορούν την αξιολόγηση αντικειμενικών θεωριών εξετάζοντας τις σχέσεις μεταξύ αυστηρά καθορισμένων μεταβλητών. Οι μεταβλητές αυτές μπορούν να μετρηθούν με τη χρήση των κατάλληλων μέτρων και να συγκεντρωθούν/οργανωθούν σε δομές (δεδομένα). Στη συνέχεια τα δεδομένα αυτά μπορούν να αναλυθούν με τη χρήσ στατιστικών μεθόδων με στόχο την εξαγωγή συμπερασμάτων και την αποδοχή, απόρριψη ή συμπλήρωση των εξεταζόμενων θεωριών.\nΚαι οι δύο προσεγγίσεις περιλαμβάνουν με τον ενάν ή τον άλλον τρόπο την έννοια της θεωρίας. Με αυτόν τον όρο συνήθως αναφερόμαστε σε μία ή περισσότερες γενικεύσεις για την που υιοθετούνται για την επεξήγηση ενός φαινομένου — την παραγωγή γνώσης. Μια επαρκής θεωρία θα πρέπει να εξηγεί ένα φαινόμενο με πειστικό τρόπο και να οδηγεί σε χρήσιμες προβλέψεις για την εξέλιξή του."

Παρότι υπάρχει κάποια επικάλυψη, οι περισσότερες ερευνητικές μελέτες ακολουθούν μια εύκολα αναγνωρίσιμη στρατηγική. Η μεγαλύτερη διάκριση που μπορούμε να κάνουμε ταξινομώντας την έρευνα με βάση τη μέθοδο είναι η διάκριση μεταξύ ποσοτικής και ποιοτικής έρευνας. Η ποσοτική και η ποιοτική έρευνα, με τη σειρά τους, περιλαμβάνουν αρκετούς διακριτούς τύπους ή μεθόδους, καθεμία σχεδιασμένη να απαντά σε διαφορετικό είδος ερευνητικού ερωτήματος.\nΠοσοτική έρευνα: Είναι η προσέγγιση που ελέγχει αντικειμενικές θεωρίες εξετάζοντας σχέσεις ανάμεσα σε μεταβλητές οι οποίες μετρώνται με όργανα/κλίμακες, ώστε τα δεδομένα (ως αριθμοί) να αναλυθούν με στατιστικές διαδικασίες. Συνήθως ακολουθείται μια δεσμευμένη, «συνταγμένη» αναφορά (εισαγωγή–θεωρία–μέθοδος–αποτελέσματα–συζήτηση), με έμφαση στον παραγωγικό/απαγωγικό έλεγχο υποθέσεων, στον έλεγχο μεροληψιών και στη δυνατότητα γενίκευσης/αναπαραγωγής ευρημάτων. Με πιο απλά λόγια, είναι έρευνα «με μέτρηση», όπου το ζητούμενο είναι η ποσοτική αποτύπωση φαινομένων (π.χ. βαθμοί, συχνότητες, δείκτες) και η εξήγηση/πρόβλεψή τους.\nΠοιοτική έρευνα: Είναι προσέγγιση που στοχεύει στην εξερεύνηση και κατανόηση των νοημάτων που αποδίδουν άτομα ή ομάδες σε ένα κοινωνικό ή ανθρώπινο ζήτημα. Η διαδικασία έχει αναδυόμενες ερωτήσεις και ευέλικτο σχέδιο, τα δεδομένα συλλέγονται συνήθως στο φυσικό πεδίο των συμμετεχόντων (π.χ. συνεντεύξεις, παρατηρήσεις, έγγραφα/οπτικό υλικό) και αναλύονται επαγωγικά σε θέματα/κατηγορίες, με τον ερευνητή να ερμηνεύει τα ευρήματα. Με απλά λόγια, είναι έρευνα «με λόγια και νοήματα», που δίνει προτεραιότητα στο πλαίσιο, στις πολλαπλές οπτικές και σε πλούσιες αφηγήσεις/περιγραφές για να φωτίσει το φαινόμενο."

    "text": "Ο φιλόσοφος Charles Peirce αναγνώρισε τέσσερις διαφορετικές μεθόδους μάθησης. Αυτές είναι:\n\nΗ μέθοδος της εμμονής: Οι άνθρωποι διατηρούν κάποιες πεποιθήσεις μόνο και μόνο επειδή πάντοτε τις είχαν. Αυτό έχει ως συνέπεια, πολύ συχνά να εμμένουν πεισματικά στις ιδέες τους, στηρίζοντας την παραγωγή νέας γνώσης σε λανθασμένες υποθέσεις.\nΗ μέθοδος της αυθεντίας: Τα άτομα στρέφονται για την αλήθεια σε όσους κατέχουν θέσεις κύρους: στην εκκλησία, στους ηγέτες τους, στους ανωτέρους τους και στους ειδικούς. Αν μια ιδέα έχει δημόσια/κοινωνική αποδοχή, τότε θεωρείται αληθής. Ο Peirce υποστηρίζει ότι η μέθοδος της αυθεντίας είναι ανώτερη από τη μέθοδο της εμμονής, διότι μέσω αυτής μπορεί να επιτευχθεί ανθρώπινη πρόοδος–έστω και αργά. Η αυθεντία φαίνεται να αποτελεί αναγκαία συνθήκη της κοινωνικής ζωής. Συχνά, οι ομάδες ανθρώπων αποδέχονται ως νομιμοποιημένη εξουσία σε όσους βρίσκονται σε θέσεις αυθεντίας. Δηλαδή, η ομάδα νομιμοποιεί την πεποίθηση ότι οι φορείς αυθεντίας έχουν όχι μόνο το δικαίωμα αλλά και την υποχρέωση να καθοδηγούν τους άλλους.\nΗ μέθοδος της διαίσθησης: βασίζεται σε παραδοχές που είναι προφανείς – τέτοιοι ισχυρισμοί γίνονται δεκτοί ως αυτονόητοι. Ενδέχεται να συμφωνούν με τη λογική, αλλά όχι κατ’ ανάγκην με την εμπειρία. Η ιδέα φαίνεται να είναι ότι τα άτομα μπορούν να ανακαλύψουν την αλήθεια χρησιμοποιώντας τον λόγο και τη λογική, επειδή υπάρχει μια φυσική ροπή προς την αλήθεια. Δεν ισχύει πάντα αυτό. Σήμερα γνωρίζουμε ότι ο κόσμος είναι σφαιρικός και όχι επίπεδος, παρότι επί αιώνες η επίπεδη γη ήταν αυτονόητη για τους ανθρώπους. Το κριτήριο της μεθόδου της διαίσθησης είναι ότι το υπό εξέταση ζήτημα είναι «αυτονόητο» και απλώς «στέκει λογικά». Δυστυχώς, πολλές αυτονόητες θέσεις απλώς δεν είναι αληθείς.\nΗ αναστοχαστική μέθοδος (επιστημονική μέθοδος): παρέχει έναν τρόπο να παγιώνονται οι πεποιθήσεις έτσι ώστε «το τελικό συμπέρασμα κάθε ανθρώπου να πρέπει να είναι το ίδιο». Η επιστημονική προσέγγιση διαθέτει δύο μοναδικά χαρακτηριστικά που απουσιάζουν από τις άλλες μεθόδους γνώσης: η επιστήμη είναι αυτοκριτική και αυτοδιορθωτική. Αυτές οι δικλείδες έχουν σχεδιαστεί ώστε να ελέγχουν και να επαληθεύουν τις διαδικασίες και τα πειράματα και να παράγουν αξιόπιστα αποτελέσματα. Ακόμη κι αν μια υπόθεση υποστηρίζεται, ο ερευνητής παραμένει σκεπτικός και αναζητά ανταγωνιστικές υποθέσεις, προσπαθώντας να εντοπίσει αντιπαραδείγματα και να βελτιώσει τα ευρήματα.\n\n\n\n\nΗ αντικειμενικότητα είναι βασικό στοιχείο της επιστημονικής μεθόδου. Είναι η κρίση για τα πράγματα η οποία στέκεται έξω και χωριστά από το άτομο (επιστήμονα) και δεν επηρεάζεται από προσωπικές προτιμήσεις και μεροληπτικές αντιλήψεις. Στα πλαίσια της εκπαιδευτικής έρευνας, η αντικειμενικότητα είναι χαρακτηριστικό της μεθόδου που υιοθετείται και όχι κατ’ανάγκη του ατόμου που την υιοθετεί. Στόχος είναι οι μέθοδοι που θα χρησιμοποιηθούν να είναι ξεκάθαρες και ακριβείς ώστε να διασφαλίζεται η δυνατότητα επανάληψης των αποτελεσμάτων από τρίτους.\nΈνας από τους βασικούς πυλώνες της επιστημονικής μεθόδου είναι η σκέψη και ο συλλογισμός. Ο συλλογισμός μπορεί να είναι επαγωγικός ή παραγωγικός.\n\n\nΕίδη συλλογισμού\n\nΟ επαγωγικός συλλογισμός που στηρίζεται στη γενίκευση συμπερασμάτων από την παρατήρηση περιορισμένου αριθμού σχετικών γεγονότων ή εμπειριών.\nΟ παραγωγικός συλλογισμός περιλαμβάνει την εξαγωγή συμπερασμάτων πατώντας πάνω σε γενικές αρχές, παρατηρήσεις και εμπειρίες (γενικεύσεις).\n\nΠαρά τα πολλά πλεονεκτήματά τους, τόσο ο επαγωγικός όσο και ο παραγωγικός συλλογισμός συχνά δεν επαρκούν για την κατανόηση του κόσμου πέρα από το άμεσο περιβάλλον του παρατηρητή. Πρέπει να συνδυαστούν με την επιστημονική μέθοδο, ώστε να αντληθούν στο μέγιστο τα πλεονεκτήματά τους. Η επιστημονική μέθοδος είναι μία τακτοποιημένη διαδικασία συγκεκριμένων βημάτων: αναγνώριση ενός προβλήματος, διατύπωση των επιστημονικών υποθέσεων, συλλογή δεδομένων, ανάλυση των δεδομέων, διατύπωση συμπερασμάτων με επιβεβαίωση ή απόρριψη των αρχικών υποθέσεων.\nΗ εφαρμογή της επιστημονικής μεθόδου υπονοεί την παραδοχή διάφορων υποθέσεων, ακόμα και αν πολύ συνχά αυτές δεν περιγράφονται συγκεκριμένα. Μερικές από αυτές είναι:\n\nΥπάρχει ένας κόσμος ο οποίος μπορεί να μελετηθεί, ακόμα και αν αυτός ο κόσμος είναι ο εσωτερικός κόσμος του ατόμου — όπως συμβαίνει συχνά στην εκπαιδευτική έρευνα.\nΈνα μέρος του κόσμου είναι μοναδικό, ένα μέρος είναι κανονικό ή εμφανίζει μοτίβα και είναι προβλέψιμο, ενώ ένα μεγάλο μέρος είναι δυναμικό (μεταβαλλόμενο) και σύνθετο (περιλαμβάνει πολλά αλληλεπιδρόντα στοιχεία). Σημαντικό καθήκον της επιστημονικής έρευνας είναι να εντοπίζει το προβλέψιμο μέρος του κόσμου, με στόχο την εξαγωγή συμπερασμάτων για περισσότερα από ένα άτομο.\nΤο μοναδικό, το κανονικό και το σύνθετο στον κόσμο μπορούν να μελετηθούν.\nΜπορούμε να διακρίνουμε μεταξύ περισσότερο και λιγότερο εύλογων ισχυρισμών, καθώς και μεταξύ έρευνας υψηλής και χαμηλής ποιότητας. Για παράδειγμα, μέσω εμπειρικής έρευνας μπορούμε να επιλέξουμε ανάμεσα σε ανταγωνιστικές θεωρίες διαπιστώνοντας ποια ταιριάζει καλύτερα στα δεδομένα. Μπορούμε επίσης να αξιολογήσουμε την ποιότητα μιας μελέτης εξετάζοντας τις ερευνητικές στρατηγικές που εφαρμόστηκαν και τα τεκμήρια που παρέχονται για καθένα από τα συμπεράσματα που εξάγει ο/η ερευνητής/τρια.\n\nοι δυνατότητες της επιστημονικής μεθόδου δεν είναι ατελείωτες, αλλά υπάρχουν σημαντικοί περιορισμοί που πρέπει να γνωρίζει οποιοσδήποτε θέλει να ασχοληθεί με την εκπαιδευτική έρευνα:\n\nΔεν μπορούν όλα τα ερωτήματα να απαντηθούν μόνο με τη χρήση της επιστημονικής μεθόδου. Για παράδειγμα, υπάρχουν ζητήματα όπως η νομιμοποίηση της ευθανασίας που αφορούν προσωπικές φιλοσοφίες, ηθική και αξίες που δεν μπορούν αξιολογηθούν στα πλαίσια μίας επιστημονικής μελέτης.\nΗ εφαρμογή των αρχών της επιστημονικής μεθόδου δεν μπορεί ποτέ να οδηγήσει στην πλήρη κατανόηση του συνόλου των φαινομένων που μελετώνται. Η εξαγωγή των συμπερασμάτων στηρίζεται στη μελέτη μίας απλοποιημένης εκδοχής της πραγματικότητας.\nΌλες οι μετρήσεις πάντα συνοδεύονται από κάποιο βαθμό σφάλματος ενώ τα μεγέθη που μετρώνται συνήθως αφορούν υποκατάστατα των πραγματικών.\n\n\n\nΕπιστημονική έρευνα\n\nΕπιστημονική έρευνα είναι η τυπική, συστηματική εφαρμογή της επιστημονικής μεθόδου στη μελέτη προβλημάτων\nΕκπαιδευτική έρευνα είναι η τυπική, συστηματική εφαρμογή της επιστημονικής μεθόδου στη μελέτη εκπαιδευτικών προβλημάτων.\n\nΣυνήθως, μία επιστημονική μελέτη εκτελείται ακολουθώντας μία προκαθορισμένη ακολουθία βημάτων που περιγράφονται παρακάτω:\n\nΕπιλογή και ορισμός προβλήματος: Ένα πρόβλημα είναι ένα ερώτημα ενδιαφέροντος που μπορεί να ελεγχθεί ή να απαντηθεί μέσω της συλλογής και ανάλυσης δεδομένων. Αφού εντοπιστεί το ερευνητικό ερώτημα, οι ερευνητές συνήθως ανασκοπούν τη βιβλιογραφία στο ίδιο θέμα και χρησιμοποιούν αυτές τις πληροφορίες για να διατυπώσουν εύλογες και τεκμηριωμένες υποθέσεις για τα αποτελέσματα.\nΣυλλογή δεδομένων: Σε μεγάλο βαθμό, οι διαδικασίες συλλογής δεδομένων καθορίζονται από το ερευνητικό ερώτημα και τις μεταβλητές της μελέτης.\nΑνάλυση δεδομένων: Τα δεδομένα αναλύονται με τρόπο που επιτρέπει στον/στην ερευνητή/τρια να ελέγξει την ερευνητική υπόθεση ή να απαντήσει στο ερευνητικό ερώτημα. Η ανάλυση συνήθως περιλαμβάνει την εφαρμογή μίας ή περισσότερων στατιστικών τεχνικών. Σε ορισμένες μελέτες, η ανάλυση περιλαμβάνει λεκτική σύνθεση αφηγηματικών δεδομένων. Τέτοιες μελέτες συνήθως προσφέρουν νέες ιδέες για τα υπό εξέταση φαινόμενα, παράγουν υποθέσεις για μελλοντική έρευνα ή και τα δύο.\nΕξαγωγή και διατύπωση συμπερασμάτων: Τα συμπεράσματα βασίζονται στα αποτελέσματα της ανάλυσης των δεδομένων. Πρέπει να διατυπώνονται σε σχέση με την αρχική υπόθεση ή το ερευνητικό ερώτημα. Τα συμπεράσματα θα πρέπει να υποδεικνύουν, για παράδειγμα, αν η ερευνητική υπόθεση υποστηρίχθηκε ή όχι. Στις μελέτες που βασίζονται σε λεκτική σύνθεση, τα συμπεράσματα είναι πολύ πιο επιφυλακτικά.\n\n\n\n\nΚάθε εκπαιδευτική διερεύνηση τελικά συνεπάγεται μια απόφαση να μελετηθεί ή να περιγραφεί κάτι — να τεθεί ένα ερώτημα και να αναζητηθεί μια απάντηση. Κάθε εκπαιδευτική διερεύνηση προϋποθέτει ότι θα συλλεχθεί κάποιο είδος δεδομένων, ότι τα δεδομένα θα αναλυθούν με κάποιον τρόπο και ότι ο/η ερευνητής/τρια θα καταλήξει σε κάποιο συμπέρασμα ή ερμηνεία. Με άλλα λόγια, κάθε εκπαιδευτική διερεύνηση μοιράζεται τις ίδιες τέσσερις βασικές ενέργειες που βρίσκουμε στην επιστημονική μέθοδο. Ωστόσο, δεν είναι ακριβές να λέμε ότι όλη η εκπαιδευτική έρευνα αποτελεί εφαρμογή της επιστημονικής μεθόδου. Υπάρχουν σημαντικές διαφορές ανάμεσα στους τύπους ερωτημάτων που θέτουν οι ερευνητές, στους τύπους δεδομένων που συλλέγουν, στη μορφή ανάλυσης των δεδομένων και στα συμπεράσματα που ο/η ερευνητής/τρια μπορεί να εξαγάγει με νόημα και εγκυρότητα.\nΜπορούμε να ξεχωρίσουμε δύο γενικές κατευθύνσεις στην εκτέλεση της επιστημονικής έρευνας: την διερευνητική και την επιβεβαιωτική. Στην επιβεβαιωτική προσέγγιση ο/η ερευνητής/τρια κάνει παρατηρήσεις, τις μελετά αναζητώντας μοτίβα και προτείνει συμπεράσματα και γενικεύσεις. Αντίθετα, στην επιβεβαιωτική προσέγγιση, ο/η ερευνητής/τρια ξεκινά από την διατύπωση μίας λογικής (με βάση τις υπάρχουσες θεωρίες) υπόθεσης, συλλέγει τα δεδομένα που θα χρησιμοποιηθούν για τον έλεγχο της υπόθεσης και αποφασίζει αν θα αποδεχτεί ή αν θα απορρίψει την υπόθεση με βάση τα δεδομένα που έχει μπροστά του/της.\nΌποια κατεύθυνση και αν επιλεγεί από τον/την ερευνητή/τρια, θα χρειαστει να καθοριστεί και μία συγκεκριμένη ερευνητική προσέγγιση. Οι ερευνητικές προσεγγίσεις είναι σχέδια και διαδικασίες για την έρευνα που καλύπτουν τα στάδια από τις ευρείες παραδοχές έως τις λεπτομερείς μεθόδους συλλογής, ανάλυσης και ερμηνείας δεδομένων. Το σχέδιο αυτό συνεπάγεται αρκετές αποφάσεις, οι οποίες δεν χρειάζεται να ληφθούν με τη σειρά που μας φαίνεται λογική ούτε με τη σειρά παρουσίασής τους εδώ. Η συνολική απόφαση αφορά ποια προσέγγιση θα χρησιμοποιηθεί για τη μελέτη ενός θέματος. Την απόφαση αυτή θα πρέπει να καθοδηγούν οι φιλοσοφικές παραδοχές που φέρνει ο/η ερευνητής/τρια στη μελέτη, οι διαδικασίες διερεύνησης (οι λεγόμενοι «σχεδιασμοί έρευνας») και οι συγκεκριμένες ερευνητικές μέθοδοι συλλογής, ανάλυσης και ερμηνείας δεδομένων. Η επιλογή μιας ερευνητικής προσέγγισης βασίζεται επίσης στη φύση του υπό εξέταση ερευνητικού προβλήματος ή ζητήματος, στις προσωπικές εμπειρίες των ερευνητών και στο κοινό στο οποίο απευθύνεται η μελέτη.\nΓενικά, οι επιστημονικές προσεγγίσεις μπορούν να χωριστούν σε τρεις μεγάλες κατηγορίες: τις ποσοστικές προσεγγίσεις, τις ποιοτικές προσεγγίσεις και τις μικτές προσεγγίσεις.\nΟι ποσοτικές ερευνητικές προσεγγίσεις αφορούν την αξιολόγηση αντικειμενικών θεωριών εξετάζοντας τις σχέσεις μεταξύ αυστηρά καθορισμένων μεταβλητών. Οι μεταβλητές αυτές μπορούν να μετρηθούν με τη χρήση των κατάλληλων μέτρων και να συγκεντρωθούν/οργανωθούν σε δομές (δεδομένα). Στη συνέχεια τα δεδομένα αυτά μπορούν να αναλυθούν με τη χρήσ στατιστικών μεθόδων με στόχο την εξαγωγή συμπερασμάτων και την αποδοχή, απόρριψη ή συμπλήρωση των εξεταζόμενων θεωριών.\nΚαι οι δύο προσεγγίσεις περιλαμβάνουν με τον ενάν ή τον άλλον τρόπο την έννοια της θεωρίας. Με αυτόν τον όρο συνήθως αναφερόμαστε σε μία ή περισσότερες γενικεύσεις για την που υιοθετούνται για την επεξήγηση ενός φαινομένου — την παραγωγή γνώσης. Μια επαρκής θεωρία θα πρέπει να εξηγεί ένα φαινόμενο με πειστικό τρόπο και να οδηγεί σε χρήσιμες προβλέψεις για την εξέλιξή του.\n\n\n\nΗ επιστημονική έρευνα μπορεί να χωριστεί σε κατηγορίες με διάφορους τρόπους ανάλογα τους σκοπούς και τους επιστημονικούς στόχους που τίθενται. Παρακάτω περιγράφονται εν συντομία οι διάφοροι τύποι της επιστημονικής έρευνας, χωρίς το υλικό αυτό να αποτελεί μία εξαντλητική αναφορά όλων των δυνατών ερευνητικών μεθόδων.\nΑνάλογα με τους σκοπούς της η επιστημονική έρευνα μπορεί χωριστεί στις ακόλουθες κατηγορίες:\n\nΒασική/Θεμελιώδης έρευνα: Στοχεύει στην επέκταση της θεωρίας και της γενικής γνώσης χωρίς άμεση πρακτική εφαρμογή. Οι ερωτήσεις καθοδηγούνται από το «πώς λειτουργεί» ένα φαινόμενο και όχι από συγκεκριμένο πρακτικό πρόβλημα.\nΕφαρμοσμένη έρευνα: Αποσκοπεί στην επίλυση σαφώς ορισμένων πρακτικών προβλημάτων ή στη λήψη αποφάσεων σε πραγματικά περιβάλλοντα, συχνά προσαρμόζοντας/ελέγχοντας θεωρίες στο πεδίο.\nΑξιολογική έρευνα: Συστηματική διερεύνηση της αξίας/αποτελεσματικότητας προγραμμάτων/πολιτικών για λήψη αποφάσεων σχετικά με βελτίωση, συνέχιση ή λογοδοσία.\nΈρευνα δράσης: Έρευνα που διεξάγεται από τους ίδιους τους επαγγελματίες με κυκλική διαδικασία σχεδιασμού–δράσης–παρατήρησης–αναστοχασμού για τη βελτίωση της τοπικής πρακτικής.\n\nΑνάλογα με τους επιστημονικούς στόχους της η επιστημονική έρευνα μπορεί χωριστεί στις ακόλουθες κατηγορίες:\n\nΈρευνα διερεύνησης: Πραγματοποιείται όταν γνωρίζουμε λίγα. Αποσαφηνίζει έννοιες, αναδεικνύει μοτίβα και παράγει αρχικές υποθέσεις/ερωτήματα για επόμενες μελέτες.\nΠεριγραφική έρευνα: Αποσκοπεί στην ακριβή αποτύπωση χαρακτηριστικών/συχνοτήτων ενός φαινομένου χωρίς παρέμβαση ή χειρισμό μεταβλητών.\nΑναλυτική έρευνα: Υπερβαίνει την περιγραφή, εξετάζοντας και αναλύοντας υπάρχουσες πληροφορίες για κριτικές αξιολογήσεις και ερμηνείες.\nΔιαγνωστική έρευνα: Στοχεύει στον εντοπισμό αιτιών/παραγόντων που υποκρύπτονται πίσω από ένα πρόβλημα ή μια κατάσταση.\nΕπεξηγηματική/Αιτιακή έρευνα: Ελέγχει εάν και πώς μία μεταβλητή επηρεάζει μια άλλη, με σχέδια που υποστηρίζουν αιτιακή συμπερασματολογία.\nΈρευνα πρόβλεψης:. Αξιοποιεί γνωστές σχέσεις μεταξύ μεταβλητών για να προβλέψει μελλοντικές καταστάσεις/αποτελέσματα.\n\n\n\n\nΜια ερευνητική μέθοδος περιλαμβάνει τη συνολική στρατηγική που ακολουθείται για τη συλλογή και την ανάλυση δεδομένων. Παρότι υπάρχει κάποια επικάλυψη, οι περισσότερες ερευνητικές μελέτες ακολουθούν μια εύκολα αναγνωρίσιμη στρατηγική. Η μεγαλύτερη διάκριση που μπορούμε να κάνουμε ταξινομώντας την έρευνα με βάση τη μέθοδο είναι η διάκριση μεταξύ ποσοτικής και ποιοτικής έρευνας. Η ποσοτική και η ποιοτική έρευνα, με τη σειρά τους, περιλαμβάνουν αρκετούς διακριτούς τύπους ή μεθόδους, καθεμία σχεδιασμένη να απαντά σε διαφορετικό είδος ερευνητικού ερωτήματος.\nΠοσοτική έρευνα: Είναι η προσέγγιση που ελέγχει αντικειμενικές θεωρίες εξετάζοντας σχέσεις ανάμεσα σε μεταβλητές οι οποίες μετρώνται με όργανα/κλίμακες, ώστε τα δεδομένα (ως αριθμοί) να αναλυθούν με στατιστικές διαδικασίες. Συνήθως ακολουθείται μια δεσμευμένη, «συνταγμένη» αναφορά (εισαγωγή–θεωρία–μέθοδος–αποτελέσματα–συζήτηση), με έμφαση στον παραγωγικό/απαγωγικό έλεγχο υποθέσεων, στον έλεγχο μεροληψιών και στη δυνατότητα γενίκευσης/αναπαραγωγής ευρημάτων. Με πιο απλά λόγια, είναι έρευνα «με μέτρηση», όπου το ζητούμενο είναι η ποσοτική αποτύπωση φαινομένων (π.χ. βαθμοί, συχνότητες, δείκτες) και η εξήγηση/πρόβλεψή τους.\nΠοιοτική έρευνα: Είναι προσέγγιση που στοχεύει στην εξερεύνηση και κατανόηση των νοημάτων που αποδίδουν άτομα ή ομάδες σε ένα κοινωνικό ή ανθρώπινο ζήτημα. Η διαδικασία έχει αναδυόμενες ερωτήσεις και ευέλικτο σχέδιο, τα δεδομένα συλλέγονται συνήθως στο φυσικό πεδίο των συμμετεχόντων (π.χ. συνεντεύξεις, παρατηρήσεις, έγγραφα/οπτικό υλικό) και αναλύονται επαγωγικά σε θέματα/κατηγορίες, με τον ερευνητή να ερμηνεύει τα ευρήματα. Με απλά λόγια, είναι έρευνα «με λόγια και νοήματα», που δίνει προτεραιότητα στο πλαίσιο, στις πολλαπλές οπτικές και σε πλούσιες αφηγήσεις/περιγραφές για να φωτίσει το φαινόμενο."

    "text": "Ο φιλόσοφος Charles Peirce αναγνώρισε τέσσερις διαφορετικές μεθόδους μάθησης. Αυτές είναι:\n\nΗ μέθοδος της εμμονής: Οι άνθρωποι διατηρούν κάποιες πεποιθήσεις μόνο και μόνο επειδή πάντοτε τις είχαν. Αυτό έχει ως συνέπεια, πολύ συχνά να εμμένουν πεισματικά στις ιδέες τους, στηρίζοντας την παραγωγή νέας γνώσης σε λανθασμένες υποθέσεις.\nΗ μέθοδος της αυθεντίας: Τα άτομα στρέφονται για την αλήθεια σε όσους κατέχουν θέσεις κύρους: στην εκκλησία, στους ηγέτες τους, στους ανωτέρους τους και στους ειδικούς. Αν μια ιδέα έχει δημόσια/κοινωνική αποδοχή, τότε θεωρείται αληθής. Ο Peirce υποστηρίζει ότι η μέθοδος της αυθεντίας είναι ανώτερη από τη μέθοδο της εμμονής, διότι μέσω αυτής μπορεί να επιτευχθεί ανθρώπινη πρόοδος–έστω και αργά. Η αυθεντία φαίνεται να αποτελεί αναγκαία συνθήκη της κοινωνικής ζωής. Συχνά, οι ομάδες ανθρώπων αποδέχονται ως νομιμοποιημένη εξουσία σε όσους βρίσκονται σε θέσεις αυθεντίας. Δηλαδή, η ομάδα νομιμοποιεί την πεποίθηση ότι οι φορείς αυθεντίας έχουν όχι μόνο το δικαίωμα αλλά και την υποχρέωση να καθοδηγούν τους άλλους.\nΗ μέθοδος της διαίσθησης: βασίζεται σε παραδοχές που είναι προφανείς – τέτοιοι ισχυρισμοί γίνονται δεκτοί ως αυτονόητοι. Ενδέχεται να συμφωνούν με τη λογική, αλλά όχι κατ’ ανάγκην με την εμπειρία. Η ιδέα φαίνεται να είναι ότι τα άτομα μπορούν να ανακαλύψουν την αλήθεια χρησιμοποιώντας τον λόγο και τη λογική, επειδή υπάρχει μια φυσική ροπή προς την αλήθεια. Δεν ισχύει πάντα αυτό. Σήμερα γνωρίζουμε ότι ο κόσμος είναι σφαιρικός και όχι επίπεδος, παρότι επί αιώνες η επίπεδη γη ήταν αυτονόητη για τους ανθρώπους. Το κριτήριο της μεθόδου της διαίσθησης είναι ότι το υπό εξέταση ζήτημα είναι «αυτονόητο» και απλώς «στέκει λογικά». Δυστυχώς, πολλές αυτονόητες θέσεις απλώς δεν είναι αληθείς.\nΗ αναστοχαστική μέθοδος (επιστημονική μέθοδος): παρέχει έναν τρόπο να παγιώνονται οι πεποιθήσεις έτσι ώστε «το τελικό συμπέρασμα κάθε ανθρώπου να πρέπει να είναι το ίδιο». Η επιστημονική προσέγγιση διαθέτει δύο μοναδικά χαρακτηριστικά που απουσιάζουν από τις άλλες μεθόδους γνώσης: η επιστήμη είναι αυτοκριτική και αυτοδιορθωτική. Αυτές οι δικλείδες έχουν σχεδιαστεί ώστε να ελέγχουν και να επαληθεύουν τις διαδικασίες και τα πειράματα και να παράγουν αξιόπιστα αποτελέσματα. Ακόμη κι αν μια υπόθεση υποστηρίζεται, ο ερευνητής παραμένει σκεπτικός και αναζητά ανταγωνιστικές υποθέσεις, προσπαθώντας να εντοπίσει αντιπαραδείγματα και να βελτιώσει τα ευρήματα."

    "text": "Η αντικειμενικότητα είναι βασικό στοιχείο της επιστημονικής μεθόδου. Είναι η κρίση για τα πράγματα η οποία στέκεται έξω και χωριστά από το άτομο (επιστήμονα) και δεν επηρεάζεται από προσωπικές προτιμήσεις και μεροληπτικές αντιλήψεις. Στα πλαίσια της εκπαιδευτικής έρευνας, η αντικειμενικότητα είναι χαρακτηριστικό της μεθόδου που υιοθετείται και όχι κατ’ανάγκη του ατόμου που την υιοθετεί. Στόχος είναι οι μέθοδοι που θα χρησιμοποιηθούν να είναι ξεκάθαρες και ακριβείς ώστε να διασφαλίζεται η δυνατότητα επανάληψης των αποτελεσμάτων από τρίτους.\nΈνας από τους βασικούς πυλώνες της επιστημονικής μεθόδου είναι η σκέψη και ο συλλογισμός.

Πρέπει να συνδυαστούν με την επιστημονική μέθοδο, ώστε να αντληθούν στο μέγιστο τα πλεονεκτήματά τους. Η επιστημονική μέθοδος είναι μία τακτοποιημένη διαδικασία συγκεκριμένων βημάτων: αναγνώριση ενός προβλήματος, διατύπωση των επιστημονικών υποθέσεων, συλλογή δεδομένων, ανάλυση των δεδομέων, διατύπωση συμπερασμάτων με επιβεβαίωση ή απόρριψη των αρχικών υποθέσεων.\nΗ εφαρμογή της επιστημονικής μεθόδου υπονοεί την παραδοχή διάφορων υποθέσεων, ακόμα και αν πολύ συνχά αυτές δεν περιγράφονται συγκεκριμένα.

Το σχέδιο αυτό συνεπάγεται αρκετές αποφάσεις, οι οποίες δεν χρειάζεται να ληφθούν με τη σειρά που μας φαίνεται λογική ούτε με τη σειρά παρουσίασής τους εδώ. Η συνολική απόφαση αφορά ποια προσέγγιση θα χρησιμοποιηθεί για τη μελέτη ενός θέματος. Την απόφαση αυτή θα πρέπει να καθοδηγούν οι φιλοσοφικές παραδοχές που φέρνει ο/η ερευνητής/τρια στη μελέτη, οι διαδικασίες διερεύνησης (οι λεγόμενοι «σχεδιασμοί έρευνας») και οι συγκεκριμένες ερευνητικές μέθοδοι συλλογής, ανάλυσης και ερμηνείας δεδομένων. Η επιλογή μιας ερευνητικής προσέγγισης βασίζεται επίσης στη φύση του υπό εξέταση ερευνητικού προβλήματος ή ζητήματος, στις προσωπικές εμπειρίες των ερευνητών και στο κοινό στο οποίο απευθύνεται η μελέτη.\nΓενικά, οι επιστημονικές προσεγγίσεις μπορούν να χωριστούν σε τρεις μεγάλες κατηγορίες: τις ποσοστικές προσεγγίσεις, τις ποιοτικές προσεγγίσεις και τις μικτές προσεγγίσεις.\nΟι ποσοτικές ερευνητικές προσεγγίσεις αφορούν την αξιολόγηση αντικειμενικών θεωριών εξετάζοντας τις σχέσεις μεταξύ αυστηρά καθορισμένων μεταβλητών. Οι μεταβλητές αυτές μπορούν να μετρηθούν με τη χρήση των κατάλληλων μέτρων και να συγκεντρωθούν/οργανωθούν σε δομές (δεδομένα). Στη συνέχεια τα δεδομένα αυτά μπορούν να αναλυθούν με τη χρήσ στατιστικών μεθόδων με στόχο την εξαγωγή συμπερασμάτων και την αποδοχή, απόρριψη ή συμπλήρωση των εξεταζόμενων θεωριών.\nΚαι οι δύο προσεγγίσεις περιλαμβάνουν με τον ενάν ή τον άλλον τρόπο την έννοια της θεωρίας. Με αυτόν τον όρο συνήθως αναφερόμαστε σε μία ή περισσότερες γενικεύσεις για την που υιοθετούνται για την επεξήγηση ενός φαινομένου — την παραγωγή γνώσης. Μια επαρκής θεωρία θα πρέπει να εξηγεί ένα φαινόμενο με πειστικό τρόπο και να οδηγεί σε χρήσιμες προβλέψεις για την εξέλιξή του."

Παρακάτω περιγράφονται εν συντομία οι διάφοροι τύποι της επιστημονικής έρευνας, χωρίς το υλικό αυτό να αποτελεί μία εξαντλητική αναφορά όλων των δυνατών ερευνητικών μεθόδων.\nΑνάλογα με τους σκοπούς της η επιστημονική έρευνα μπορεί χωριστεί στις ακόλουθες κατηγορίες:\n\nΒασική/Θεμελιώδης έρευνα: Στοχεύει στην επέκταση της θεωρίας και της γενικής γνώσης χωρίς άμεση πρακτική εφαρμογή. Οι ερωτήσεις καθοδηγούνται από το «πώς λειτουργεί» ένα φαινόμενο και όχι από συγκεκριμένο πρακτικό πρόβλημα.\nΕφαρμοσμένη έρευνα: Αποσκοπεί στην επίλυση σαφώς ορισμένων πρακτικών προβλημάτων ή στη λήψη αποφάσεων σε πραγματικά περιβάλλοντα, συχνά προσαρμόζοντας/ελέγχοντας θεωρίες στο πεδίο.\nΑξιολογική έρευνα: Συστηματική διερεύνηση της αξίας/αποτελεσματικότητας προγραμμάτων/πολιτικών για λήψη αποφάσεων σχετικά με βελτίωση, συνέχιση ή λογοδοσία.\nΈρευνα δράσης: Έρευνα που διεξάγεται από τους ίδιους τους επαγγελματίες με κυκλική διαδικασία σχεδιασμού–δράσης–παρατήρησης–αναστοχασμού για τη βελτίωση της τοπικής πρακτικής.\n\nΑνάλογα με τους επιστημονικούς στόχους της η επιστημονική έρευνα μπορεί χωριστεί στις ακόλουθες κατηγορίες:\n\nΈρευνα διερεύνησης: Πραγματοποιείται όταν γνωρίζουμε λίγα. Αποσαφηνίζει έννοιες, αναδεικνύει μοτίβα και παράγει αρχικές υποθέσεις/ερωτήματα για επόμενες μελέτες.\nΠεριγραφική έρευνα: Αποσκοπεί στην ακριβή αποτύπωση χαρακτηριστικών/συχνοτήτων ενός φαινομένου χωρίς παρέμβαση ή χειρισμό μεταβλητών.\nΑναλυτική έρευνα: Υπερβαίνει την περιγραφή, εξετάζοντας και αναλύοντας υπάρχουσες πληροφορίες για κριτικές αξιολογήσεις και ερμηνείες.\nΔιαγνωστική έρευνα: Στοχεύει στον εντοπισμό αιτιών/παραγόντων που υποκρύπτονται πίσω από ένα πρόβλημα ή μια κατάσταση.\nΕπεξηγηματική/Αιτιακή έρευνα: Ελέγχει εάν και πώς μία μεταβλητή επηρεάζει μια άλλη, με σχέδια που υποστηρίζουν αιτιακή συμπερασματολογία.\nΈρευνα πρόβλεψης:. Αξιοποιεί γνωστές σχέσεις μεταξύ μεταβλητών για να προβλέψει μελλοντικές καταστάσεις/αποτελέσματα."

    "text": "Μια ερευνητική μέθοδος περιλαμβάνει τη συνολική στρατηγική που ακολουθείται για τη συλλογή και την ανάλυση δεδομένων. Παρότι υπάρχει κάποια επικάλυψη, οι περισσότερες ερευνητικές μελέτες ακολουθούν μια εύκολα αναγνωρίσιμη στρατηγική. Η μεγαλύτερη διάκριση που μπορούμε να κάνουμε ταξινομώντας την έρευνα με βάση τη μέθοδο είναι η διάκριση μεταξύ ποσοτικής και ποιοτικής έρευνας. Η ποσοτική και η ποιοτική έρευνα, με τη σειρά τους, περιλαμβάνουν αρκετούς διακριτούς τύπους ή μεθόδους, καθεμία σχεδιασμένη να απαντά σε διαφορετικό είδος ερευνητικού ερωτήματος.\nΠοσοτική έρευνα: Είναι η προσέγγιση που ελέγχει αντικειμενικές θεωρίες εξετάζοντας σχέσεις ανάμεσα σε μεταβλητές οι οποίες μετρώνται με όργανα/κλίμακες, ώστε τα δεδομένα (ως αριθμοί) να αναλυθούν με στατιστικές διαδικασίες. Συνήθως ακολουθείται μια δεσμευμένη, «συνταγμένη» αναφορά (εισαγωγή–θεωρία–μέθοδος–αποτελέσματα–συζήτηση), με έμφαση στον παραγωγικό/απαγωγικό έλεγχο υποθέσεων, στον έλεγχο μεροληψιών και στη δυνατότητα γενίκευσης/αναπαραγωγής ευρημάτων. Με πιο απλά λόγια, είναι έρευνα «με μέτρηση», όπου το ζητούμενο είναι η ποσοτική αποτύπωση φαινομένων (π.χ. βαθμοί, συχνότητες, δείκτες) και η εξήγηση/πρόβλεψή τους.\nΠοιοτική έρευνα: Είναι προσέγγιση που στοχεύει στην εξερεύνηση και κατανόηση των νοημάτων που αποδίδουν άτομα ή ομάδες σε ένα κοινωνικό ή ανθρώπινο ζήτημα. Η διαδικασία έχει αναδυόμενες ερωτήσεις και ευέλικτο σχέδιο, τα δεδομένα συλλέγονται συνήθως στο φυσικό πεδίο των συμμετεχόντων (π.χ. συνεντεύξεις, παρατηρήσεις, έγγραφα/οπτικό υλικό) και αναλύονται επαγωγικά σε θέματα/κατηγορίες, με τον ερευνητή να ερμηνεύει τα ευρήματα. Με απλά λόγια, είναι έρευνα «με λόγια και νοήματα», που δίνει προτεραιότητα στο πλαίσιο, στις πολλαπλές οπτικές και σε πλούσιες αφηγήσεις/περιγραφές για να φωτίσει το φαινόμενο."
